    Normalize filters to the standard format of a list of lists of filters, where each
    inner list represents a conjunction (AND) of filters and the outer list represents
    a disjunction (OR) of the inner conjunctions.

    We make a special case for the empty filter list, which is treated as no filters.
    Typically, a disjunction of no expressions should be false, but the user likely
    intends to apply no filters, and [] is easier to work with than [[]].
